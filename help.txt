In Phase 1, we built a low-latency voice loop. This is the core engine for a real-time voice assistant.
In short, we created a system that:
Listens continuously to the microphone.
Transcribes the speech into text almost instantly after i stop talking.
Responds immediately with computer-generated speech.
Supports Barge-In, meaning it stops talking the moment we start, making the conversation feel natural and not forcing me to wait.
